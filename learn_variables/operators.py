# an operator performs an action, an operand is what the operator performs on
x = 5
y = 1

add = x + y
subtract = x - y
multiply = x * y
divide = x / y
remainder = x % y

# x > y - x greater than y
# x < y - x less than y
# x == y - check if equal
# x >= y - x greater than or equal to y
# x <= y - x less than or equal to y
