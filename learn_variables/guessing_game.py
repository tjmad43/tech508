# Guess the word with 4 hints to help
# Rationale: Practice word slicing
# Type of exercise: Finish the code
original_word = "recommendation"
scrambled_word = "eoommandretnic"
# Create the hint slices...
# TO DO: On the next line, replace "?" with a string slice in the format "original_word[x:y]". Use the hints below to know what slice is needed
hint1_slice = original_word[4:6]
# TO DO: On the next line, replace "?" with a string slice in the format "original_word[x:y]". Use the hints below to know what slice is needed
hint2_slice = original_word[-3:]
# TO DO: On the next line, replace "?" with a string slice in the format "original_word[x:y]". Use the hints below to know what slice is needed
hint3_slice = original_word[7:10]
# TO DO: On the next line, replace "?" with a string slice in the format "original_word[x:y]". Use the hints below to know what slice is needed
hint4_slice = original_word[:2]
